# Variable Naming Rules

Good variable names make your code understandable. Python rules:

- Must start with a letter or underscore (_)
- Cannot start with a number
- No spaces or special characters (!, @, #, etc.)
- Cannot use reserved keywords (if, while, return, etc.)

**Good examples:**

```python
first_name = "Anna"
student_id = 12345
_max_limit = 100
```

**Bad examples:**

```python
2nd_place = "John"  # starts with a number
first name = "Anna"  # contains space
if = 10  # reserved keyword
```

**Tips:**  
- Use `snake_case` (e.g., total_sum)  
- Choose names that describe the purpose (user_input, price_with_tax)
