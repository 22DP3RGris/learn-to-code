# Introduction to Variables

Variables are containers for storing data in a program. They allow you to store values that can later be accessed or changed.

**Python syntax for creating a variable:**

```python
age = 72
name = "Anna"
height = 1.63
```

**Rules:**  
- No need to specify the type — Python detects it automatically.  
- Values can be any data type: numbers, text, lists, etc.

**Practical example:**

```python
user_name = "Laura"
print("Hello, " + user_name)
```

**Why is this important?**  
Variables are the foundation of any program — without them, it's impossible to store or manipulate data.
